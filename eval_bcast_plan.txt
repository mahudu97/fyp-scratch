Investigate B num columns:
  - PyFR panels B in 48 columns (AVX-512 - 6 kernel runs)
    - allows for higher level threading / homogenous comp

  - This panel of B will fit into L2/L3
    - Each 8 column stride fits into L1

  - We report kernel performance over 48 column iterations

  - TEST:
    - chose a kernel
    - run with varying B columns
    - Hypothesis: Per 48 iteration should be same after large enough width

Re Run benchmarks -
  - On PyFR suite

  - Synthetic Matrics - random placement (uniform) - obj to see peak CSE gains
    - Vary Size
    - Vary number of distinct constants
    - Vary density

  - Plots pseudo FLOPS per 48 col panel
    - for PyFR suite - per problem type
    - for synthetic suite - per vary

Report Preq:
  - Chapter 2: where the matrices arise - visualize examples from the PyFR suite
  - Chapter 4: Outline Methodology
  - Chapter 5: Broadcast evaluation
